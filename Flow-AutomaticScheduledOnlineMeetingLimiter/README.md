This Microsoft Flow checks incoming calendar items to see if:
- The invite is for a Teams meeting.
- The invite is for a non-recurring meeting.
- The invite is not for an all-day event.

If all of the above are true, and the date for the invite already contains a 
certain number of calendar items, the meeting gets declined with a response.
